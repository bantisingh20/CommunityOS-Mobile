 * write fails as a transport error the guard screen enqueues it here and flushes on reconnect. Each
 * queued item carries a stable {@link QueuedGateCapture.idempotencyKey} so re-sending records the
 * entry/exit at most once, even if the first attempt actually reached the server before the socket
 * dropped (the backend's Idempotency-Key store replays the original result).
 *
 * <p>Backed by the same {@link SecureStorage} the token store uses (expo-secure-store), so it
 * survives app restarts. ponytail: a single JSON blob under one key, read-modify-write — a gate's
 * backlog is a handful of items, not a database; a structured store would be more than this needs.
 * The known ceiling is in-process serialization of flushes (not concurrent-safe across instances),
 * which is fine for one device's one queue.</p>
